- list security symbols on front page, user can click to be taken to that security's page
- columns to view my active orders in the order book
- buttons to click trade in the order book gui
-- set lot size e.g. directly to 1, 5, 10, or up/down like +/-1, +/-10, +/-100
-- click bids/offers to place order there

- FIXME show empty book message if there are no orders rather than just blank space (remove empty levels from the book object)
- FIXME remove empty positions from accounts
- user's orders page, filter by status
- cancel active order
- edit order (will cancel and submit a new one)
- show user's trade history
- show graph of traded prices (and/or top level of book) for security
- show graph of user's balance over time
- include some incentive against users escalating betting to infinite loss (charge interest on margin, or don't let them go below a certain amount of debt)
- security type: option
- let security have an underlying of an existing security or a "print" (just a value that isn't a traded security)
- if underlying is a security, this derivative on that security needs to specify how settlement price is determined (e.g. last traded price before deadline)
- specify expiration date
- if settles by print, the security's admin needs to input that value once security has expired
- start players off with an amount of fake money 
- don't expose stack trace to users, send a 500 page and console.err the error
- how to prevent race condition with multiple users creating securities with same symbol?
- let user change how many book levels are shown
- maybe move order book to a partial view so it can be included in other pages, pass params as object like include('partials/orderBook', params)
- future on time amounts (quoted in hours and minutes)
- be able to type minus sign in number input box on mobile
- last traded price should be average of whole trade, not just last level traded
- average traded price (and/or cost basis) of position
- anytime security symbol is mentioned, can click it to go to info page
- security needs description about what it is for
- is there an easy way to get a nicer mobile UI? some existing stylesheet that can do both desktop and mobile automatically?
