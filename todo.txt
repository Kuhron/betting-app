- list security symbols on front page, user can click to be taken to that security's page
- cancel active order
- edit order (will cancel and submit a new one)
- page to view my active orders
- columns to view my active orders in the order book
- buttons to click trade in the order book gui
-- set lot size e.g. directly to 1, 5, 10, or up/down like +/-1, +/-10, +/-100
-- click bids/offers to place order there

- show empty book if there are no orders
- security admin actions: halt trading, settle/expire
- if security is halted, buttons to resume or settle
- if security is active, buttons to halt or settle
- security type: boolean (delta)
- security type: option
- let security have an underlying of an existing security or a "print" (just a value that isn't a traded security)
- if underlying is a security, this derivative on that security needs to specify how it is settled (e.g. last traded price before deadline)
- specify expiration date
- if settles by print, the security's admin needs to input that value once security has expired
- start players off with an amount of fake money 
- don't expose stack trace to users, send a 500 page and console.err the error
- how to prevent race condition with multiple users creating securities with same symbol?
- let user change how many book levels are shown
- maybe move order book to a partial view so it can be included in other pages, pass params as object like include('partials/orderBook', params)
