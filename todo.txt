- list security symbols on front page, user can click to be taken to that security's page

- page to show user's positions
- add new security (and this user will set its admin password, and then anyone knowing that password can do admin stuff like settle the security, halt trading, etc.)
- security type: boolean (delta)
- security type: option
- let security have an underlying of an existing security or a "print" (just a value that isn't a traded security)
- if underlying is a security, this derivative on that security needs to specify how it is settled (e.g. last traded price before deadline)
- specify expiration date
- if settles by print, the security's admin needs to input that value once security has expired
- matching engine
- start players off with an amount of fake money
